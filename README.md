# Watermarking
Watermarking project for cinema

The goal of this project was to create a non visible watermark inside of a video to prevent people from capturing the movie during a cinema projection.

The algorithm used are based on discrete wavelet transform to encode a message inside of the video. This message can then be retrieved inside of the illegal capture of the movie to get the location of the cinema where the illegal capture was done.
